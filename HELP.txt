=== How do I create a map with this? ===

--- Step 1: Listing places that you want to see on your map ---

At the first screen, use the [+] button to add an input field.

Into this input field, write the name of a place. For technical reasons,
this name has to correspond exactly with the `name` field of a place on
OpenStreetMap.

{?} FOR THE CURIOUS:
This is because fuzzy-searching with regex takes much longer than
hard-searching for exact text, so you the user would be waiting a lot
longer for the Overpass API to load everything if this program did use
regex searching.

{!} IMPORTANT:
Also, keep in mind how many places might have that name. If you
search for "Trollface Parkway", you're not just getting the
"Trollface Parkway" that's next to where you live, you're getting
every single "Trollface Parkway" on Earth. That might be a lot,
depending on what search phrase you're looking for.

If you want to include another place, click the [+] button again,
and write your second place name into the second input field.

The [^] button moves an input field one spot up, while the [v] button
moves it one spot down. If you want to remove a slot, the [-] button
removes the last input field in the list. To remove an input field at
some other position than the last, click the [v] button to move it
to the end, then click the [-] button.

Once you have all the places you want to see, click the [Build Map]
button, grab something to eat or drink, use the bathroom, find a
Youtube video essay to watch, because this might take a bit of time.

--- Step 2: Looking at your really cool map ---

Once your map is loaded, you might notice that there are a lot more
objects than you asked for. This is because Fancy Map Snapper uses
the places you've listed to generate a bounding box, then it queries
for everything inside of that bounding box.

Objects ("ways" on OpenStreetMap) are either polygons or sequences
of lines. They may have names, or they may be unnamed. On the right,
there is a scroll panel that has every object on the map. The three
radio buttons determine how that object is rendered: green means that
both the object itself and the label with its name are rendered, yellow
means that only the object's shape is rendered while its name label
is hidden, and red means that the object is completely hidden and not
rendered at all.

The nine buttons above the scroll panel do mass selections: [Show All]
sets every object to shown and labeled, [Un-Label All] sets every
object to shown but not labeled, and [Hide All] sets every object to
completely hidden.

The [Show Areas], [Un-Label Areas], and [Hide Areas] buttons do the same
with all of the polygonal areas on the map, the ones that are filled with
a solid color. Similarly, the [Show Paths], [Un-Label Paths], and
[Hide Paths] buttons do the same with the paths on the map, that are
stroked with colored lines and not filled.

On the edges of the map, there are arrow buttons: [<], [^], [>], and [v].
These, depending on direction, will either shrink or grow the bounding box.

After expanding the bounding box, you may notice that the map is largely
barren outside the loaded area. To remedy this, click the [Repopulate Bounding Box]
button on the bottom left. This will return to the "Loading..." screen,
but once the map is done loading, every single object present within
the entire bounding box will be loaded onto the map.

{!} IMPORTANT:
Depending on the size of your bounding box, this may take a while.

On the bottom left, there is an input field and an [Add] button. This
searches the OSM Overpass API for an object with the name that is typed
into the input field, and adds it to the map without expanding the
bounding box, and without searching for anything else in the same
bounding box.

--- Step 3: Keeping your map so you may treasure and cherish it ---

Finally, to export the rendered map, click the [Export] button. This
saves it as a PNG file in the `exports` directory and displays it to
you inside your file explorer.

To return to the initial screen where you list the places you want
to see on your map, click the [Close] button.
